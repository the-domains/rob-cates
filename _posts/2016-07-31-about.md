Rob works as a singer-songwriter, ESTILL trained vocal coach and worship leader in the UK and Europe. He currently divides his time between his private and university teaching practice in singing and voice; choral & orchestral direction, coaching and workshops; speaking, preaching and leading worship at churches, conferences and events including at his home church, [Catch the Fire London][0]. Rob works across the genres of rock & pop, musical theatre, RnB, soul, gospel and contemporary Christian worship music.

Rob was born in Suffolk and grew up around the choral church music of the Salvation Army. Much of this music was influenced by the revival hymns of Ira Sanky and the American Revival Camp meetings which had a huge impact on the development of African-American religious music. It is no surprise therefore that early on Rob developed a love of Gospel music.

When Rob was a teenager his parents would take him to see the London Community Gospel Choir on their visits to Suffolk. This love of Gospel continued as Rob studied for a Bachelor of Music at City University London and piano at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama with [Peter Bithell][1]. In 2001 Rob was awarded a bursary to study piano with John Lill and Elana Riu at [Dartington International Summer School][2]. Rob joined various gospel choir's and founded a gospel choir at City for the student-led summer festival. Having completed African-American studies and written a dissertation on British Gospel, Rob continued his studies at the University of York where he gained a Master of Arts in Community Music, while studying singing with [Yvonne Seymour][3]. It was here that he founded the [Zamar Gospel Choir][4] which continues to go from strength to strength even today.

On his return to London, Rob continued to study and sing gospel music while completing his PGCE in Secondary Music Education. In 2010 Rob was made a Fellow of the College of Teachers and awarded Chartered London Teacher Status. Rob has worked in music education since 2004 across the age spectrum from primary through to postgraduate levels teaching everything from classical piano through to music technology, BTEC, GCSE and A-level, and now as First Study Voice Tutor for the [Theology, Music and Worship][5] degree at the London School of Theology.

From 20013-2015 Rob completed Level 1 & 2 and Advanced training in the ESTILL Voice System, with Anne-Marie Speed & Associates of [The Voice Explained][6] at the Royal Academy of Music and Urdang Academy.
